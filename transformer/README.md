# Transformers

This repository contains an implementation of Transformers, a powerful architecture originally designed for machine translation. The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need," can be adapted for various natural language processing tasks.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training
To train the Transformer model, you can use the train.py script. The following command shows an example of how to run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Evaluation
To evaluate a pre-trained model, use the evaluate.py script. The following command provides an example:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path models/model.pth --config configs/eval_config.yaml
```

### Inference
For inference, use the inference.py script. Here is an example command:

```bash
python inference.py --text_path path/to/text.jpg --model_path path/to/model.pth --config configs/inference_config.yaml
```

## Model Architecture
The original Transformer model consists of the following components:

- Embedding Layer: Converts input tokens into continuous vector representations.
- Positional Encoding: Adds information about the position of tokens in the sequence to the embeddings.
- Transformer Encoder: Applies multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks to process the input sequence.
- Transformer Decoder: Uses masked self-attention, encoder-decoder attention, and feed-forward networks to generate the output sequence.
- Output Layer: A fully connected layer followed by a softmax activation function to produce the final output, such as translated text.

# Datasets
