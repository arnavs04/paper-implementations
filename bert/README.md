# BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

This repository contains an implementation of BERT, a powerful pre-training architecture for natural language processing tasks. BERT, introduced in the paper "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding", can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on a wide range of benchmarks.

## Key Features

- Bidirectional context understanding
- Pre-training on large text corpora
- Fine-tuning for specific NLP tasks
- Suitable for various applications, including:
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  - Question Answering
  - Text classification
